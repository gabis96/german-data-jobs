data_jobs_germany
==============================

While searching for data jobs in Germany, a lot of questions started comming up. What are the most 'in demand' data jobs/titles? Which cities have more data related job offers? What are the language requirements? 

In this project I look forward to do an exploratory data analysis of the job-market related to data in Germany, to answer some of my questions. NLP is used to process the job descriptions to get more information of the job offers. 

Roadmap
------------
1. Define Problem and Questions

2. Collect Data
    - Identify and collect the data needed and the sources to get them from.
    - If dealing with high volume of data, work with Big Data technologies.
    - Verify the acquired data is applicable and reliable.  

3. Wrangle Data
    - Explore, organize and clean the data.
    - Extract relevant information. Use NLP to extract from description.
    - Enrich the original data with added custom fields.  
    - Validate and publish data.

4. Explore Data 
    - Apply basic statistical methods to the data.
    - Plot variables´ data points to identify distributions.
    - Discover correlation and causation between features.
    - Answer initial questions.

5. Create Dashboard in Tablau

6. Build Pipeline 

Python Stack
------------
**Math & Machine Learning:** sklearn, numpy.

**Data Manipulation:** pandas (for datasets), requests & BeautifulSoup (for web scrapping).

**Visualization:** mathplotlib, plotly, geopandas, Tablau.


Data Stack
------------
**Data collection:** web scrapping.

**Data wrangling:** cleaning, structuring, enriching, and validating data.

**Exploratory Data Analisys:** descriptive statistics, correlation and causation.

**NLP:** process natural language (English & German).

**Dashboard** 

**Pipeline Deployment**

Initial Assumptions
------------
- Most offers state german language as a requirement.
- Berlin, Munich and Frankfurt rank hights in workers demand (meaning more job offerings in these cities).
- Berlin and Munich rank hights in english speaking job offers. 
- Data Analyst or Data Engineer rank highest in demand, comparing to Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Architect, etc.
- Data Science positions offer higher payments overall.
- Around 50% of Data Science job offers require a master degree.
- Hybrid mode is the tendency over on-site or from home.
